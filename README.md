# ⚽ Football Player Detection using YOLOv8

## 📌 Introduction
This project demonstrates football player detection in match videos using YOLOv8.  
The model is pretrained on the COCO dataset and detects the `person` class to identify players on the field.

The notebook processes input video, performs object detection, and saves an annotated output video.
